### Experimental Dataset
The dataset used in this study originates from the Department of Pathology at a domestic hospital, comprising cytopathology images collected through Rapid On-Site Evaluation (ROSE) during fine needle aspiration of pulmonary masses. All images are stained with Diff-Quik, captured at 400x magnification with a resolution of 50 Âµm/pixel, and stored as JPEG files with dimensions of 1916x1010 at 96 dpi.

#### Cell Types:
The dataset contains six types of lung cells:
1. **Adenocarcinoma:** Irregular gland structures, increased nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio, and disordered arrangements.
2. **Squamous Cell Carcinoma:** Polygonal or irregular shapes with distinct cell boundaries and keratinization.
3. **Carcinoid:** Uniform medium-sized cells with regular nuclear shapes and slower growth.
4. **Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC):** Morphological diversity excluding the characteristics of small cell lung cancer.
5. **Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC):** Small cell size, dense nuclei, high nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio, and frequent mitoses.
6. **Normal Lung Cells:** Regular cell size and shape, low nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio, and absence of atypia.
